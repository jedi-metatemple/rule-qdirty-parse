# rule-qdirty-parse
The original quick-and-dirty parser for the Jedi Rule's XML-based markup language

## Development Status
This Expat-based parser is a quick-and-dirty early parser. Once all the specifics of how
the markup tagset is to work are congealed, work on a long-term parser may possibly
begin. However, it will probably not be a continuation of this parser.

# rule-qdirty-parse
The original quick-and-dirty parser for the Jedi Rule's XML-based markup language

## Development Status
This Expat-based parser is a quick-and-dirty early parser. Once all the specifics of how
the markup tagset is to work are congealed, work on a long-term parser may possibly
begin. However, it will probably not be a continuation of this parser.

## Dependencies
Besides the _ubiquitous_ stuff, this parser will not run (and quite possibly
might not install, but I'm not sure about the won't-install part) unless
[Chobakwrap|https://github.com/sophia-collaborations/chobakwrap] is installed and up-to-date.
